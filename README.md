I'm currently a 4th-year student in **Intelligent Systems Engineering** at UIE Campus Coruña, with a strong focus on AI applications in motorsport analytics. I'm also an alumnus of the **Engineering Summer Programme (2023)** at Girton College, Cambridge University, where I gained foundational knowledge in quantum mechanics, jet engines, and nanotechnology.

Continuously expanding my expertise through self-directed learning, I'm currently completing the **Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng** on Coursera, among other certifications and courses in AI and data science, such as **IBM Deep Learning with PyTorch, Keras and Tensorflow Professional Certificate**.

## 🌟 About Me

* 🏁  **Dedicated to Formula 1 AI & Data Analytics** : I channel my passion for F1 into projects like  **F1 Strategy Manager** , developing multi-model AI systems that combine machine learning, computer vision, and NLP to optimize race strategies.
  * *Related work* : Authored research on applying rule-based expert systems and predictive modeling to F1 strategy optimization.
* 💡  **Driven by AI-Powered Sports Analytics** : My academic background is heavily focused on machine learning, deep learning, and intelligent systems, with a strong mathematical foundation. I'm passionate about decoding complex F1 phenomena through data analysis, extracting meaningful patterns from telemetry data, weather conditions, and team communications to understand the subtle factors that determine race outcomes.
* 🌱  **Committed to AI Model Optimization** : I specialize in identifying and implementing the most effective AI models for complex, multi-dimensional racing data. From tire degradation patterns to strategic decision points, I enjoy building systems that transform raw data into predictive insights that would be impossible to detect manually.
